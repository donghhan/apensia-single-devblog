# Question

Signature ⊕ returns value with two integers aligned together. For instance,

12 ⊕ 3 = 123
3 ⊕ 12 = 312

Given the positive integer of `a` and `b`, provide a `solution` function that `return`s which of the value is much bigger
which are a ⊕ b or 2 \* `a` \* `b`

if a ⊕ b and 2 \* `a` \* `b` return same value, then return a ⊕ b.

<br />

# Analysis

This problem is basically about converting String and Number in JavaScript.

In order to compute the ⊕ sign, I firstly needed to convert `a` and `b` as string values and combine them up and convert
its type into number so that I could compare the value of 2 \* `a` \* `b`.

### hi

```js focus=1
function solution(a, b) {
  const computedValue = +(String(a) + String(b));
  const toCompare = 2 * +a * +b;

  return computedValue >= toCompare ? computedValue : toCompare;
}
```
